        Long ago, in the legendary kingdom of Dholakpur, a prophecy spoke of an
        ancient secretâ€”one that could bestow eternal wisdom upon its bearer.
        Hidden within the sacred archives of the Grand Temple, the puzzle
        remained unsolved for centuries, challenging even the most brilliant
        minds.

        The kingdoms scholars dedicated their lives to deciphering the
        inscriptions carved into stone tablets, each inscribed with cryptic

        stars, consulting astrologers and celestial maps.

        tiniest details, and questioned everything he saw. Unlike others before
        him, he dared to embrace the simplest of actions.
